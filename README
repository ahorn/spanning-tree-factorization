== About ==

This package contains a polynomial time graph algorithm which decomposes an n-complete graph of even order into edge-disjoint, isomorphic copies of a spanning tree whose edges form an Euler trail of length n-1. More general graph theoretical results about cyclic spanning tree decompositions can be found in~\cite{FK02}.
